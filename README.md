# Collision Response with OpenGL
This project uses Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes for early collision detection(sweep and prune). Oriented Bounding Boxes are used after the sweep and prune phase.
Multiple contact points are used for collision response.

My own math library is used for educational purpose.
